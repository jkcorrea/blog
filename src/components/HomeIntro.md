As you may have guessed, I code. Another feature of mine is that *I think too much*. This is an attempt to boil all those thoughts down to something coherent and just maybe, if I'm lucky, of use to of you.

Previously I worked at üçéApple & started a YC-backed startup (failed to launch, postmortem coming soon!).
<br />
<br />
I also co-founded a pretty unconventional [dating site](http://agencyla.co) & community where we [dig into](http://agencyla.co) the nitty gritty of relationships & dating.

These days I'm focusing on a space dear to my heart: [helping other builders like myself](https://honchojs.com).
