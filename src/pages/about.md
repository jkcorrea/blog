## Who are you and why should I care?

I grew up pretty conventionally in the greater Los Angeles area. Go to school, get good grades, church on Sundays, play sports, make friends, etc. I got into computers at a very early age thanks to Warcraft 3 & some phpBB forums (the nostalgia!). I loved to tinker and build things, whether it be mini-games, 3d models/animations, or editing video game highlight reels for me and my friends. I was getting really good at it! Then school happened.

I went to CMU and between a quite fun social life & difficult courswork, I completely lost touch with the creator in me. Before I knew it I turned into an *amazing* widget producer, from which I would go on to produce widgets as an engineer at Apple (something to be proud of, I was told).

After 4 years of uni and 4 at Apple, I broke free of the mold and had my first attempt at a startup with one of my best friends. Within a month we had backing from the prestigious Y-Combinator accelerator! Three months after that we had nothing.

What I realized was that the person I had become was *so far off* from the person I needed to be to make a startup successful. I knew how to work inside a larger organization, but not for myself.

It's been 3 years since I left the walled garden to create my own greener pastures. The soil here is still pretty barren. I've learned a lot and am making the proper adjustments.

My hope is that by sharing some of my experiences, by opening up about the things I'm maybe not so proud of, and by willing to be vulnerable, I can help you out in your journey while I figure out mine.
