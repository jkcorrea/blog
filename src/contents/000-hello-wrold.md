> Starting off my blog with probably the #1 reminder I'm constantly need: don't let perfect get in the way of very good.


I spent 5 seconds thinking of the title for this blog post. If I did this right, I'll have spent 5 minutes writing the body. Will I be happy with it? Not entirely, and that'd be great.

You know what I wasted 5 hours on earlier today?

- Tinkering with this site's CSS
- Optimizing the *linter* settings to my personal preference
- Debugging an issue with an [Astro](http://astro.build) feature that I didn't even end up using

The thing that most consistently has been getting in the way of my progress is chasing perfection. There's such a strong urge to optimize, gather all the data, make the "right" decision, etc that even if I'm aware that I'm doing it I still need to exercise a fair bit of will-power to not.

So, I'll spend 0 time editing or backtracking on this post (Ok I lied, I did a *teensy* bit of editing). I'm not going to worry about the fact that I couldn't weave a secondary point, "turning lemons into lemonade", into this post (I'll get to it in another post). I'm just going to write and publish and hope that I can carry this momentum forward.


Progress, never perfection.
